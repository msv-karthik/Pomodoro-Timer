# Pomodoro-Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer web application that allows users to manage their work and break intervals. It enables users to input their desired Pomodoro and break times, and the timer will alternate between work and break sessions, helping users stay productive.

## Features

- Customizable Pomodoro and Break durations (in minutes)
- Countdown timer for both Pomodoro and Break intervals
- Pause and Resume functionality
- Clean and responsive UI design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for the timer functionality)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pomodoro-timer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd pomodoro-timer
```
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to start using the Pomodoro Timer.

## How It Works

1. Upon opening the application, users will be prompted to enter their desired Pomodoro and Break times in minutes.
2. After entering the times, the timer will start counting down the Pomodoro session.
3. Once the Pomodoro session ends, the Break session will begin.
4. Users can pause or resume the timer at any time during the countdown.
5. The app will automatically loop through the Pomodoro and Break sessions until the user exits or refreshes the page.

### Example

- Enter a Pomodoro time (e.g., 25 minutes).
- Enter a Break time (e.g., 5 minutes).
- Click on "Submit" to start the timer.
- The timer will count down, alternating between Pomodoro and Break.

## Customization

You can customize the Pomodoro and Break times by modifying the input values in the form. The default values are:

- **Pomodoro**: 25 minutes
- **Break**: 5 minutes

To change these values, simply enter new times in the input fields before starting the timer.
